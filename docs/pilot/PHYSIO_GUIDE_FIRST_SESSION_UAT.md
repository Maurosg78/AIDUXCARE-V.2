# Your First Session with Aidux — UAT Pilot

Welcome to the AiduxCare pilot.  
The goal of this first session is very simple:

> Test the complete flow of an **initial assessment** using Aidux. We are not aiming for perfection, only for a smooth, realistic workflow.

---

## 1. Before you start

You will need:

- ✅ Your **pilot email and password** for the UAT environment.
- ✅ A computer with a modern browser (Chrome recommended).
- ✅ 15–20 minutes without interruptions.

> Important: this is a **test environment**. All patients are fictitious.

---

## 2. Accessing the platform

1. Open the UAT link that we sent you.

2. Click **Login / Sign in**.

3. Enter your pilot email (e.g., `pilot.physio03@aiduxcare.com`) and the password we shared with you.

4. You should see the **main dashboard / Command Centre**.

If you cannot sign in:

- Double-check the email spelling.
- Try refreshing the page.
- If the problem persists, please contact us and (if possible) attach a screenshot.

## 3. Choosing a demo patient

For this first session, please use one of the following demo patients:

- `PD-001 — Acute mechanical low back pain`
- `PD-002 — Neck pain + tension-type headaches`
- `PD-003 — Shoulder pain (rotator cuff)`
- … or any other from the list we shared.

From the dashboard:

1. Go to the **Patients** section.

2. Search for the patient by **name** or **code** (e.g., `PD-001`).

3. Open the patient and briefly review the basic information.

---

## 4. Starting an initial assessment

1. With the patient record open, look for the button **"New session"** or **"Initial assessment"**.

2. Click to start a new assessment.

3. You will see a form with standard sections (reason for visit, history, examination, etc.).

You do NOT need to fill out everything perfectly.  
What matters is:

- Entering reasonable, realistic information in the main fields (reason for visit, history, key findings).
- Using your usual clinical language.

---

## 5. Generating the SOAP note with Aidux

At the end of the form, you should find an option such as:

- **"Generate SOAP note"** or **"Generate document"**.

1. Click the generation button.

2. Wait a few seconds while Aidux processes the information.

3. A structured SOAP note (S–O–A–P) should appear.

We would like you to check:

- Does the note reflect what you would normally write (at least 60–70%)?
- Is there anything critical missing or something that should not be there?
- Does it seem to save you time compared to writing the entire note from scratch?

You can edit the generated text if you wish.

---

## 6. Saving the session / episode

1. Once you are satisfied with the note, click **"Save"** or **"Close session"**.

2. Confirm that:

   - No error messages appear.
   - The session is visible in the patient's session history.

If anything fails, please take a screenshot and briefly note what you were doing when it happened.

---

## 7. What feedback we need from you

After this first session, please tell us:

1. **Did the workflow support you or get in your way?**

2. **At what point did you feel confused or unsure about what to do next?**

3. **What would you change to make your next session faster and more natural?**

4. **Would you use Aidux in your daily practice if it was integrated with your current EMR? Why or why not?**

We will send you a very short feedback form (2–3 minutes).

---

## 8. Quick summary (cheat sheet)

If you only have a few minutes, focus on this:

1. Sign in with your pilot credentials.

2. Choose a demo patient (e.g., `PD-001`).

3. Start an **Initial assessment**.

4. Enter a minimal but realistic clinical history and findings.

5. Click **"Generate SOAP note"**.

6. Review, adjust if needed, and **save**.

7. Complete the feedback form.

If you do this, you will have achieved the main goal of the pilot:

**Check whether Aidux saves you time and gives you clinical and medico-legal confidence when documenting.**

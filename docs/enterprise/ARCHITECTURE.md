# AI/ML Architecture (Draft)

This document describes the high-level AI/ML architecture used to deliver reliable, secure, and observable features. It is intentionally concise and implementation-agnostic so it can evolve alongside product needs.

#### Prompt Versioning Header (minimal snippet)

**Overview.** The architecture separates ingestion, processing, and serving to reduce coupling and to make capacity planning straightforward. Ingestion focuses on data quality, schema evolution, and privacy; processing handles feature engineering, training, and evaluation; serving exposes fast, predictable interfaces with progressive rollouts and guardrails.

**Data contracts.** Producers publish versioned contracts covering fields, types, semantics, and PII classification. Consumers validate contracts with CI checks before accepting new payloads. Backfills and reprocessing jobs must declare contract versions to keep lineage auditable and reproducible.

**Feature pipeline.** Offline transforms run as idempotent batch jobs with checkpointing; online features are computed with the same code paths wherever possible to minimize train/serve skew. Every feature is documented with ownership, freshness expectations, and tests for distribution drift and null-rate regressions.

**Model training.** Training jobs pin dataset snapshots and container images. Hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts are logged to a registry. A champion/challenger pattern allows automatic canaries on representative traffic. Failed canaries roll back via a single switch, and the registry enforces that only signed, validated artifacts can be promoted to “serving-eligible.”

**Evaluation.** Beyond aggregate metrics, we track slice performance for sensitive cohorts, long-tail inputs, and adversarial cases. Shadow deployments compare outputs from the candidate model against the champion under the exact same requests and features. Significant deltas open an engineering task automatically.

**Inference and guardrails.** Serving is fronted by a thin gateway that handles authentication, quota, and request budgeting. Each endpoint supports circuit breakers, bounded concurrency, and retries with jitter. For generative use cases, responses pass through content filters, PII redaction (where appropriate), and safety classifiers before reaching clients. All prompts and outputs include minimal provenance to support investigations and user-visible audit trails.

**Observability.** We emit structured logs and traces tagged with model, dataset snapshot, and feature set versions. Golden signals include latency, saturation, error rate, and cost per 1k requests. Drift detectors alert when live distributions diverge from training baselines; alerts link directly to dashboards and runbooks.

**Lifecycle & governance.** Every model has an owner, SLOs, deprecation criteria, and an EOL date. Changes follow a lightweight RFC process with design, risk analysis, and rollback plan. A weekly review validates incident learnings, privacy commitments, and compliance requirements.

**Cost controls.** Budgets are enforced at namespace and endpoint levels. We track marginal cost per feature and per model to inform architectural choices (e.g., caching, distillation, or batching) and to prevent silent cost creep.

**Operational playbooks.** Each critical pipeline has runbooks with clear detection, diagnosis steps, and rollback commands. Post-incident reviews capture contributing factors, corrective actions, and owners with due dates. Security reviews verify threat models for data exfiltration, prompt injection, and model abuse vectors. Where feasible, we enforce defense-in-depth with allow-lists, content normalization, and strict output schemas. Teams rehearse failure scenarios quarterly so handoffs and tooling stay sharp.

**Compliance posture.** Data retention follows least-privilege and purpose limitation. Sensitive fields are tokenized at ingestion and only detokenized in secure enclaves. All access to training data is logged and periodically reviewed. When fine-tuning on user content, we honor opt-outs and document the provenance of each dataset snapshot.

**Scalability notes.** Batch workloads scale horizontally with autoscaling queues; online inference scales with per-endpoint HPA targets that consider both QPS and tail latency. Where latency budgets are tight, we colocate features, caches, and models to reduce cross-zone chatter. We also provide a cost-aware router that can downshift to distilled models when budgets are constrained or when request criticality is low.

# Sprint Report — W41 (Support) — Data & Validation
**Market:** CA  
**Language:** en-CA  
**Owner:** Data & Validation  
**Date:** 2025-10-06

---

## Executive Summary
- Kept scope strictly to **documentation and validation**, no tooling or app code changes.
- Delivered **Section 5 — Data Architecture** (≈500 words) with schema, lifecycle, indexing (ADR-003), audit, and backup.
- Added **data-lifecycle diagram** (`.svg` + source `.mmd`) under `docs/enterprise/diagrams/`.
- Raised and enforced **infra guardrails** via a rescue PR to restore Firestore/Vite config (no functional drift).
- All commits/PRs comply with **Source of Truth**: *Market: CA* and *Language: en-CA*.
- CI hooks green locally (TypeScript + ESLint) and PRs set to **Draft** while reviews complete.

## Scope This Week (W41, Support)
- Documentation only: `docs/enterprise/**`.
- No changes to `src/**`, CI, workflows, or Firestore rules.
- Assisted other threads with SoT compliance messages and guardrails.

## What We Shipped
- **Section 5 — Data Architecture**:  
  - Firestore schema for `patients`, `clinical_notes`, `note_signatures`, `consents`, `audit_logs`.  
  - Lifecycle: create → update/autosave → sign (immutable) → query → retention/erasure (PHIPA mindset).  
  - Indexes per **ADR-003** to guarantee timeline/worklist SLAs.  
  - Audit trail append-only; integrity via `immutable_hash` at sign.  
  - Backup & recovery procedural, vendor-agnostic.

- **Diagrams**:  
  - `docs/enterprise/diagrams/data-lifecycle.svg` (+ `data-lifecycle.mmd`).

- **Guardrails / Containment**:  
  - Rescue PR to restore protected infra (Firestore/Vite) and keep Data & Validation scope doc-only.

## Links (for reviewers)
- Groundwork PR (W42-W43, draft): **#137**  
- Infra restore PR (draft): **#138**  
- Section 5 — Data Architecture PR (draft): **#164**

## Validation & CI/EVALs
- Local typecheck/lint hooks passed.
- SoT trailers present on commits: `Market: CA`, `Language: en-CA`, `Signed-off-by: ROADMAP_READ`, `COMPLIANCE_CHECKED`.
- Netlify Preview building for doc branches; no app deploy required.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** accidental infra edits during rebases.  
  **Mitigation:** rescue branch workflow + protected-files list; PR #138 documents restoration and policy.
- **Risk:** indexing gaps for high-cardinality queries.  
  **Mitigation:** ADR-003 references and follow-up checklist for emulator validation in Sprint 2.

## Next (W42–W43, Primary Sprint)
- Support **Profile-based Personalization** thread; ensure persistence and metrics hooks align with Section 5 schema.
- Prepare ADR-003 cross-checks in emulator: composite indexes + query latencies.
- Keep SoT messaging Canada-first, en-CA.

**Action to reviewers:** comment **“ACK: CA/en-CA”** on the three PRs above.

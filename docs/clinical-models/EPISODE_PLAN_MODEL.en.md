# Episode Plan Clinical Model (Canonical)

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **canonical clinical model** governing how Episodes, Plans, and SOAP notes interact within the AiDuxCare platform.

It is intentionally **implementation-agnostic**. It does not describe databases, APIs, UI components, or AI providers. Instead, it defines the **clinical contract** that all technical layers must respect.

The goal of this model is to:

* Reflect real-world physiotherapy practice
* Reduce clinician cognitive load
* Ensure auditability and regulatory defensibility
* Prevent structural errors before they reach implementation

---

## 2. Core Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **The Episode is the unit of care.**
2. **The Plan belongs to the Episode, not to individual SOAP notes.**
3. **SOAP notes are session-bound clinical acts.**
4. **Follow-up sessions execute an existing Plan; they do not redefine it.**
5. **Only Initial Assessments and Reassessments may create or update the active Plan generated by the system.**
6. **Cognitive load reduction for the clinician is a first‑class product goal.**
7. **Auditability is a clinical safety feature, not an afterthought.**
8. **The licensed health professional is always the final authority.** Any system-generated content must be editable, with full traceability of manual changes preserved.

## 3. Session Types and Clinical Expectations

The platform recognizes four canonical session types. Each has a distinct clinical intent and relationship to the Episode Plan.

| Session Type              | S | O | A | P | Episode Plan Role        | SOAP Role     | Cognitive Value        |
| ------------------------- | - | - | - | - | ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Initial Assessment**    | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **CREATE v1**            | Foundational  | Defines roadmap        |
| **Follow‑up**             | ✓ | ⚠ | ⚠ | ✗ | **EXECUTE vN**           | Operational   | Reduces cognitive load |
| **Reassessment**          | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **UPDATE vN → vN+1**     | Recalibration | Adjusts course         |
| **Inpatient / Delegated** | ✓ | ⚠ | ✗ | ✗ | **REFERENCE (external)** | Traceability  | Documents execution    |

Legend:

* ✓ = Required and complete
* ⚠ = Functional / observational, not necessarily formal
* ✗ = Not generated in this session type

## 4. The Episode Plan Model (Conceptual)

The **Episode Plan** represents the longitudinal clinical intent for an Episode of care. It externalizes the clinician's reasoning so that it does not need to be recreated at every session.

The Plan is:

* Created during the Initial Assessment
* Executed during Follow‑ups
* Updated or replaced during Reassessments
* Referenced (but not owned) during Inpatient contexts

### 4.1 Minimum Conceptual Model

```ts
interface EpisodePlan {
  // Identity
  episodeId: string;
  version: number;

  // Clinical core
  functionalDiagnosis: string;

  goals: {
    shortTerm: string[];
    longTerm: string[];
    dischargeCriteria: string;
  };

  // Treatment roadmap
  phases: {
    name: string;
    expectedDuration: string;
    clinicalFocus: string[];
    progressionCriteria: string;
  }[];

  // Lifecycle metadata
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'discontinued';

  // Audit metadata
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBySessionId: string;
  lastReviewedAt?: Date;
  lastModifiedBySessionId?: string;
}
```

This model is intentionally minimal. It defines **what must exist**, not how it is stored or rendered.

## 5. Plan Lifecycle Rules

The following rules govern the lifecycle of an Episode Plan:

1. **Creation**

   * Only an Initial Assessment may create the first version of an Episode Plan.

2. **Execution**

   * Follow‑up sessions must reference the currently active Plan.
   * They may record tolerance, adherence, and micro‑adjustments, but must not redefine goals or phases.

3. **Update**

   * Only a Reassessment may update or replace the active Plan.
   * Any update results in a new Plan version.
   * Previous versions are archived and remain immutable.

4. **Reference**

   * Inpatient or delegated sessions may reference an external or institutional Plan.
   * Such sessions do not create or modify the Episode Plan.

5. **Immutability**

   * Historical Plan versions are never mutated.
   * Audit metadata must always be preserved.

## 6. Clinical Examples

### 6.1 Initial Assessment (Session 1)

**Clinical intent:** Establish the Episode contract.

* SOAP includes full S/O/A/P
* Plan defines diagnosis, goals, phases, and discharge criteria
* Episode.activePlan = v1

Result:

> The clinician no longer needs to re‑decide *what the episode is about* in future sessions.

---

### 6.2 Follow‑up Session (Session 2–5)

**Clinical intent:** Execute the Plan.

* SOAP focuses on:

  * Subjective response since last session
  * Functional observations
* Assessment may be implicit or inherited
* No new Plan is created

System responsibility:

> Clearly surface the **current phase and focus** of the active Plan to reduce cognitive load.

---

### 6.3 Reassessment (Mid‑Episode)

**Clinical intent:** Recalibrate care.

* SOAP includes full reassessment
* Objective measures are compared to baseline
* Assessment is updated
* Plan is modified or replaced → new version

Result:

> The Episode roadmap is formally adjusted and re‑anchored.

---

### 6.4 Inpatient / Delegated Session

**Clinical intent:** Document execution within a broader care plan.

* SOAP documents patient state and response
* Plan is referenced, not owned
* Focus is traceability and interdisciplinary communication

---

## 7. Scope and Non‑Goals

This document intentionally does **not** define:

* Database schemas
* API contracts
* UI layouts
* Billing or token consumption
* AI prompt design
* Guard or validation implementations

Those elements must **conform to this model**, not redefine it.

---

## 8. Why This Model Matters

By separating **Episode state** from **session documentation**, the system:

* Mirrors real clinical reasoning
* Reduces unnecessary clinician effort
* Prevents structurally invalid notes
* Enables safe automation
* Remains defensible to regulators and auditors

This model is the foundation upon which context‑aware guards, UX, analytics, and compliance features are built.

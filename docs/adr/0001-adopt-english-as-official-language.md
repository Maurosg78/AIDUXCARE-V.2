# ADR-0001: Adopt English as the official language (code & docs)

- **Date:** 2025-09-25
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context**
  Team and investors are Canada/English-first; consistency reduces friction.

- **Decision**
  All code, docs, PR titles/bodies, and commit messages in English.

- **Consequences**
  - (+) Easier onboarding, investor-readiness, consistent style.
  - (â€“) Requires one-time normalization of legacy Spanish docs (#105).

- **Alternatives Considered**
  Bilingual repo (higher maintenance), Spanish-first (hurts stakeholders).

  - Issue: #105
  - Docs: /docs/PROJECT_HANDBOOK.md, /CONTRIBUTING.md

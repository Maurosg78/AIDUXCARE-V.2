# Sprint 2 Redefinition

## Context
Post-Sprint 1, clarity emerged from user feedback: fisios need "strategic ally" not "another EMR with million features."

## Core insight
90% of clinical notes are copy-paste + minimal changes. Current EMRs (Jane.app, etc.) overwhelm with features that 95% of users never touch.

## Sprint 2 NEW focus
1. Quick recall (pre-session dashboard)
2. Continuity intelligence (progress notes, not full SOAP each time)
3. Contextual adaptation (same data, terminology adjusted per role)

## What changed from original Sprint 2
- Removed: ML learning from accept/reject patterns
- Removed: Usage tracking with modal refinement
- Added: Patient history optimization
- Added: Diff algorithm for progress notes

## Technical validation required (Day 1 Sprint 2)
- [ ] Quick recall <5s achievable?
- [ ] Diff algorithm for notes viable?
- [ ] Onboarding captures capabilities correctly?

## Go/No-Go criteria
If technical spike shows 2-week timeline unrealistic:
- Fallback: Simplified version (quick recall only, no diff)
- Or: Return to original Sprint 2 (narrower scope)

**CTO decision required after spike Thursday AM.**

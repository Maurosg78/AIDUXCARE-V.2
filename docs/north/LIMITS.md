# Aidux North â€” Limits & Non-Goals (en-CA)

- No production defaults outside **Market: CA** and **Language: en-CA**.
- Spanish content may exist only as **non-default** and **feature-flagged**.
- CI must be able to run on PRs **without secrets** for compliance gates.
- Any deviation from SoT requires explicit approval from CODEOWNERS and regulatory leads.

Security/Privacy: never connect to production services in tests unless explicitly allowed and isolated.

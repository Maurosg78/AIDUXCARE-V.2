    "summary": "Clinical presentation shows pain on outside of right wrist towards little finger, progressively worsening over 1 month with repetitive drawing/writing. Pain radiates to posterior elbow. Patterns consistent with De Quervain tenosynovitis, though C6-C7 radiculopathy should be considered given radiation pattern. Occupational factors (3D animation work) directly contribute. Patient using wrist brace and analgesics. CRITICAL: Medication interaction (Ibuprofen + Fluoxetine) requires medical review due to increased GI bleeding risk. Important to evaluate neural involvement given radiation, assess De Quervain with Finkelstein's test, and consider ergonomic modifications. Sedentary lifestyle and obesity may impact treatment approach."

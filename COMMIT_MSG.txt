feat(clinical-analysis): optimize test scoring and sidebar behavior

- Eliminate premature treatment plan generation
  * Plan now generated only after physical examination (Tab 3)
  * Clinical reasoning: requires objective findings (S+O)
  * Token optimization: ~500 tokens saved per session
  
- Improve test prioritization with scoring from Vertex AI
  * Vertex AI searches PhysioTutor, Cochrane, systematic reviews for scores
  * Anti-hallucination protection (discards scores without sources)
  * Fallback to evidence_level when scores unavailable
  * Neurological tests now correctly appear in top 5
  
- Fix test display issues
  * Prevent NaN% display when sensitivity/specificity unavailable
  * Filter sidebar tests that are already selected
  * Sidebar tests disappear when added to evaluation

Testing confirmed:
- Tab 1: No premature treatment plan visible ✓
- Tab 2: Neurological tests (Dermatomes, Myotomes) in top 5 ✓
- Tab 3: SOAP Plan section generated correctly ✓
- Sidebar: Tests removed when selected ✓
- Display: No NaN% shown when scores unavailable ✓

Impact: 
- Better clinical workflow alignment
- 5% token reduction (~500 tokens/session)
- Proper test prioritization based on evidence + scores
- Improved UX with cleaner test display

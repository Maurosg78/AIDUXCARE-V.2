## ⚡ CTO Strategic Decisions

### Q1: Confidence Threshold
**Decision**: **80% confidence threshold**
- 80%+ → Automatic follow-up mode
- 60-79% → Suggest follow-up with user confirmation
- <60% → Default to initial evaluation
- Always provide manual override option

### Q2: Token Reduction Target
**Decision**: **Target 70%, accept 60% minimum**
- Follow-up templates more focused and concise
- Skip comprehensive analysis sections
- Maintain clinical accuracy standards
- Monitor quality metrics closely during implementation

### Q3: Override Location
**Decision**: **Top of workflow + persistent sidebar option**
- Primary: Workflow selection at session start
- Secondary: Always-visible "Switch to full evaluation" option
- Clear explanation of current mode and capabilities

### Q4: Follow-up Definition
**Decision**: **Multi-factor detection algorithm**
- Primary indicators:
  - Previous episode within 30 days
  - Chief complaint contains follow-up keywords
  - Patient ID matches recent evaluation
- Secondary indicators:
  - Consultation type metadata
  - Provider notes indicate follow-up
  - Appointment scheduling data

### Q5: Quality Metrics
**Decision**: **Dual validation approach**
- Technical: Response time, token usage, completion rate
- Clinical: Random sampling review, provider feedback, accuracy spot-checks
- User Experience: Time-to-SOAP, user satisfaction, adoption rate

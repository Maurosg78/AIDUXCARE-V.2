# ✅ **CTO DECISION: HYBRID APPROACH APPROVED**

**Date:** November 2025  
**Decision Maker:** CTO  
**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED**  
**Effective Immediately**

---

## 📊 **DECISION SUMMARY**

**Approved Approach:** **Hybrid Approach (14 days, 85 hours)**

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Full Implementation too slow (14-21 days)
- ✅ Fast Track MVP leaves too much unresolved
- ✅ Hybrid balances speed + safety + usability
- ✅ Clinical Vault MVP is essential but cannot absorb entire window
- ✅ Data Residency must be resolved WITHOUT EXCEPTION
- ✅ Pipeline and Mobile need attention but not 20 days

**Official Strategy:** This is now the official execution strategy for the Canadian Physiotherapist Pilot.

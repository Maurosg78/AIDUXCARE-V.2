# ProfessionalWorkflowPage Refactoring Status

## Current State
- **File**: 4230 lines
- **Backup**: ✅ Created
- **Status**: Starting refactoring

## Strategy
Given the file size, we'll use a pragmatic approach:
1. Extract large render functions into separate components
2. Use React.lazy() for code splitting
3. Keep state/handlers in main file initially (can extract later if needed)

## Progress
- ✅ Backup created
- ✅ Directories created
- ⏳ Starting extraction...

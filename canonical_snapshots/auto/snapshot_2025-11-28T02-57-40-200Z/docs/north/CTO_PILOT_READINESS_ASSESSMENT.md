## 🏥 PILOT STABILITY REQUIREMENTS

### **Critical Question: Can we put this in front of real Canadian physiotherapists?**

**Current Assessment:** 🟡 **NOT YET** - Sprint 2 required for pilot readiness

### **Why Sprint 2 is Essential:**

**1. Clinical Reliability Gaps:**
- Clinical tests → SOAP integration inconsistent
- Professional liability concerns with inaccurate outputs
- Medical terminology standardization needed

**2. User Experience Issues:**
- Command Center still has Spanish labels (unprofessional)
- Consent workflow not fully polished
- Error handling insufficient for real-world use

**3. Data Integrity Concerns:**
- Clinical Vault persistence not guaranteed
- Risk of SOAP note loss (unacceptable for medical records)
- Audit trail gaps for PHIPA compliance

## 🚨 PILOT BLOCKER ANALYSIS

### **P1 Blockers (Cannot Pilot Without):**

**Clinical Accuracy:**
- ❌ SOAP notes must reflect selected clinical tests accurately
- ❌ Professional terminology must be consistent
- ❌ Zero tolerance for clinical inaccuracies

**Data Reliability:**
- ❌ 100% SOAP note persistence required
- ❌ No data loss scenarios acceptable
- ❌ Audit trails for all PHI access

**Professional Presentation:**
- ❌ All interfaces must be English/French (no Spanish)
- ❌ Medical-grade error handling required
- ❌ Professional consent workflows mandatory

### **P2 Important (Pilot Success Factors):**
- ⚠️ Performance optimization for clinic WiFi
- ⚠️ Comprehensive error recovery
- ⚠️ User feedback collection system
- ⚠️ Support documentation for physiotherapists

FINDINGS:

L4-L5:
- Severe central canal stenosis (8mm → 5mm)
- Large posterior disc extrusion with inferior migration
- Moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis
- Thecal sac compression
- Mass effect on descending nerve roots
- Facet joint hypertrophy contributing to stenosis

L5-S1:
- Mild degenerative changes
- No significant stenosis
- Small disc bulge without neural compression

L3-L4:
- Mild disc desiccation
- No significant pathology

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe L4-L5 central canal stenosis with disc extrusion
2. Thecal sac compression requiring urgent evaluation
3. Recommend neurosurgical consultation
